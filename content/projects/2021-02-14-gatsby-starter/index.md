### Case Study
I built a portfolio website for a local engineering firm using Gatsby. When searching for existing starters, I found modern portfolio Gatsby starters in short supply. During the build process, I found that I was able to reduce page load times by over 90% while reducing maintenance cost substantially. With some modifications, I was able to make this starter available for wider use.

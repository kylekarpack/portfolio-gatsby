### Case Study
Throughout 2021, I led the integration of the existing Marketo Measure UI into the Adobe Unified Shell framework. This involved rebranding and restyling the application, integrating with the shell, and removing obselete code.

### Outcomes
- 90% reduction in UI-related customer request tickets
- Removal of ~45k lines of code
- 40% reduction in bundle sizes and 30% reduction in page load times
- Establishment of consistent user interface across related Adobe products

### Skills Used
- TypeScript
- LESS
- C#

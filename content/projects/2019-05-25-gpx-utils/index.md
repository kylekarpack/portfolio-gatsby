### Case Study

A set of utilities designed to parse, manage, and calculate statistics from GPX files. I found that a number of my projects were using these same functions, so I decided to add strong typings in TypeScript, package up the utilities, and open-source the results as a NPM package. Please feel free to use these utilities for any project that operates on GPX files.

### Case Study
I have created a series of packages that help interact efficiently with the Gaia GPS API. The @gaia-gps-client organization includes the following:

- **@gaia-gps-client/client**: The NodeJS SDK for interacting with the Gaia GPS API. It provides bindings for reading and creating tracks, waypoints, photos, and other Gaia GPS objects
- **@gaia-gps-client/types**: Strong TypeScript typings for relevant Gaia GPS objects
- **@gaia-gps-client/graphql**: A full-featured GraphQL server that can run anywhere on your own infrastructure
- **@gaia-gps-client/react**: (WIP) a React component that can display a Gaia GPS track or other object

> **Note:** This project is not endorsed or supported by Gaia GPS, so please do not ask them for support.

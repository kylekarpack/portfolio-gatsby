### Case Study

I wanted to test out some databases other than MSSQL to evaluate their sufficiency for analytics applications that process millions of records. The first database was ElasticSearch, but I needed to populate it with many records quickly. No existing tool could accomplish this easily, so I wrote a NodeJS application that can transport this data relatively easily.

### Skills Used

- NodeJS
- ES6
- ElasticSearch
- MSSQL

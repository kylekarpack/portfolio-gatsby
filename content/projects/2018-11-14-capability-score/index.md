## Case Study

I have worked to develop an industry-leading method to provide capability information concerning manufacturing quality. This patented methodology takes many factors related to large sets of manufacturing data and outputs a simple score between 0 and 100. It also provides charts that group data based on user preference. This system allows for companies to see how capable their processes, operators, and suppliers are at making any given part in their supply chain.

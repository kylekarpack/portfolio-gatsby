import { GoodreadsBookshelf } from "react-goodreads-shelf";

### Case Study

This React component allows you to display a public Goodreads shelf in a React application. It's a lot like the Goodreads JavaScript widget, but allows for more customization, better async loading, and React-like usage.

```jsx
<GoodreadsBookshelf 
	userId="USER_ID_HERE" 
	apiKey="API_KEY_HERE" />
```

### Example
<GoodreadsBookshelf userId="63515611" apiKey="PsmXJodsWJgBPgTosjdEkQ" />

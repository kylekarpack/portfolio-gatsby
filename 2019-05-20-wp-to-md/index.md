### Case Study

When moving my site off WordPress, I needed a tool to save off hundreds of pages, posts, images, and more. All the existing tools I could find were WordPress-based: written in PHP and often sluggish. Using the WordPress API, I was able to come up with a much cleaner, faster implementation. If you're looking to migrate from WordPress to a static site generator, give this tool a shot.
